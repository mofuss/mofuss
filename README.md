## MoFuSS Overview

* This project uses Google Earth Engine for data download, R for data preparation and graphs, C++ for harvest probabiility maps, DINAMICA EGO for geospatial simulations (core scripts), ffmpeg for animations, and LaTeX for final reports.
* 6 sequential scripts are run on your local machine to generate the stage-1 results.
* Stage-1 results are sent to the HPC cluster for the geospatial simulations and sent back to your local machine.
* Stage-2 results are used on your local machine to generate the final results and reports, formatted in LaTeX.
* As of November 25, 2024, the project does not include a license, effectively making it closed source. While others can view the code, they cannot legally use, modify, or distribute it. We plan to reopen the project after completing the development of the web-MoFuSS interface. This interface will provide the most user-friendly way to run MoFuSS with your own parameters on our HPC clustersâ€”no installation required.
