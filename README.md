### **Welcome to the New MoFuSS GitHub Account!**

As of November 2024, weâ€™ve officially migrated from the MoFuSS GitLab account to this GitHub platform. Please note that the GitLab account will be permanently erased soon to avoid any confusion.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your support as we continue to grow!

MoFuSS uses Google Earth Engine for data download, R for data preparation and graphs, C++ for harvest probabiility maps, DINAMICA EGO for geospatial simulations (core scripts), ffmpeg for animations, and LaTeX for final reports.

As of November 25, 2024, the project does not include a license, effectively making it closed source. While others can view the code, they cannot legally use, modify, or distribute it. We plan to reopen the project after completing the development of the web-MoFuSS interface. This interface will provide the most user-friendly way to run MoFuSS with your own parameters on our HPC clustersâ€”no installation required.
